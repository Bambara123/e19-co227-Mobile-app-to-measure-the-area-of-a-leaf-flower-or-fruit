## Introduction

 The crop department of agriculture faculty is expecting to use a mobile app to measure the area of a leaf, flower or fruit.Through advanced image analysis algorithms, AgroCam precisely calculates areas, catering to the irregular shapes often found in nature. Our user-friendly interface guides you through the process, making it accessible even to those new to digital measurement techniques.
