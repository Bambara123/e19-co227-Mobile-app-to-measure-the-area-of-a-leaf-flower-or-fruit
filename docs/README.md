## Introduction

The crop department of agriculture faculty is expecting to use a mobile app to measure the area of a leaf, flower or fruit. Through advanced image analysis algorithms, AgroCam precisely calculates areas, catering to the irregular shapes often found in nature. Our user-friendly interface guides you through the process, making it accessible even to those new to digital measurement techniques.

## Objective

The principal goal is to develop a mobile application designed to facilitate the calculation of leaf surface area. This application aims to provide a valuable tool for researchers, students, and farmers, streamlining their tasks and enhancing their ability to measure and analyze leaves more efficiently.
